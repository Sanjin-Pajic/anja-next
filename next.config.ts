/**
 * The main Next.js configuration file.
 * 
 * Can be used to finetune settings which affect how the application is built and run. We can 
 * customize build processes, enable optimizations, configure routing, env variables, etc.
 * 
 * This file should serve as the foundation for improving app performance, and 
 * configuring environment-specific settings for the types of environments.
 * However at the current moment we require no adjustments to this logic.
 * 
 * @example
 * // ex of enabling Webpack 5 for builds:
 * {
 *   webpack5: true
 * }

## About

This is a relatively simple application for a business of mine, which is planned to eventually make it to Production, with no due dates set. At the current moment, it will also have the value of adapting a React-experienced developer to the Next.js environment and way of thinking.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
